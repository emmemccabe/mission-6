Mission 6: Musical Metacreation

I wanted to create a score that encorporated a "four chord" song. Many famous pop and soft rock songs were created using only the chords: E minor, G major, C major, and D major. I held the chords as variable in Sonic Pi as:

e = chord(:E5, :minor)
g = chord(:G5, :major)
c = chord(:C5, :major)
d = chord(:D5, :major)

The program was very fun to tinker with and improve. It was also nice to brush up on Ruby programming skills I learned last year. I used live coding for the background beats (after messing with pretty much all of the samples, I definitely liked the bd_ beats the best!), and loops for the melody, using different synths (pluck and piano). Thanks for showing us this awesome tool!
